This is a test of the rich-editor json update algorithm!

A fragment starts here!
You can modify text between the start and end lines,
without any problems what so ever!
... and ends here!

Content outside of the fragments can also be modified!

Another fragment starts here!
The purpose of this algorithm is to allow you to define some point in a file
and for that point to persist across changes. Even when those changes are not
made from within the rich-editor.
and the second fragment ends here!

The file is not parsed. The file does not need to have a specific syntax for this to work.
You may have any arbitrary text between the start and end of a fragment.
