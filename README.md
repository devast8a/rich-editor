# rich-editor
This is just a demo for the algorithm that mechanism that anchors references in a rich-editor's files to source files - updating the references in the event that the source files are modified without involving the rich-editor.
This is most useful for editing code where the units that are being edited are smaller than a file (functions or classes for example) - Think LightTable or Flow Based Programming graph editors except without placing restrictions on the programming language or projects.
